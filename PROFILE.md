Welcome to my GitHub profile!

In this class, I would like to learn how to create an html website.

Today (9/5/2025) I learned how to create a new repository in github.com, clone it into the Github desktop, create a new branch, commit the branch, puch the branch, open a pull request, and approve the pull request.
